###BATTHLE SHIP GAME
## Synopsis

Battleship is a game that consists of sinking the 5 boats that are in the sea. We have 20 shots to get it, if you do not get those shots you will lose the game

## Motivation

I created this game because I found it interesting to practice two-dimensional arrays, and also to practice methods and control objects.

##Problems

The problems that I have encountered when it comes to creating the game, have been a few. But the biggest problem has been to place the boats randomly and do not step on each other (sometimes it happens ...)

## Instruccions

The instructions are very simple.__
To attack with the cannon (attackCanon (x, y)).__
To attack with the plane (attackPlane (x, y)).__
To attack with the Bomber (attackBomber (x, y)).__
