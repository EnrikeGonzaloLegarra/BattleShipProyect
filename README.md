#BATTHLE SHIP GAME
## Synopsis

Battleship is a game that consists of sinking the 5 boats that are in the sea. We have 20 shots to get it, if you do not get those shots you will lose the game

## Motivation

I created this game because I found it interesting to practice two-dimensional arrays, and also to practice methods and control objects.

##Problems

The problems that I have encountered when it comes to creating the game, have been a few. But the biggest problem has been to place the boats randomly and do not step on each other (sometimes it happens ...)
At this moment you have no option to win

##Future iterations

Second player
Finish the game by winning
Do not place boat in the position of another boat


##Instructions

The instructions are very simple.<br>
To attack with the cannon (attackCanon (x, y)).<br>
To attack with the plane (attackPlane (x, y)).<br>
To attack with the Bomber (attackBomber (x, y)).<br>
